Given the coalition's shared pool is empty and contributions so far have not yielded additional benefits, I will not contribute this turn to retain all harvested resources for myself. Staying in the coalition does not affect my immediate score this turn, so no coalition changes are needed.",2025-07-03T15:59:22.401100,,,3
"[{'type': 'HARVEST', 'amount': 10}]",,agent_008,,,,,agent_decision,,,,,"This is the final turn (3/3), so maximizing immediate personal score is the priority. The main pool has 10 resources left, which I can harvest entirely. Since the coalition's shared pool currently holds 0 resources, contributing would not yield any returns this turn. Also, leaving the coalition would forfeit any potential equal share, but since the shared pool is zero, it doesn't matter. Therefore, I will harvest all 10 resources and keep them personally without contributing. This maximizes my immediate gain.",2025-07-03T15:59:24.898693,,,3
