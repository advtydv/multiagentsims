def execute(persona, market, personas, plan): 
  """
  Given a plan (action's string address), we execute the plan (actually 
  outputs the tile coordinate path and the next coordinate for the 
  persona). 

  INPUT:
    persona: Current <Persona> instance.  
    market: An instance of current <Market>.
    personas: A dictionary of all personas in the world. 
    plan: This is a string address of the action we need to execute. 
       It comes in the form of "{world}:{sector}:{arena}:{game_objects}". 
       It is important that you access this without doing negative 
       indexing (e.g., [-1]) because the latter address elements may not be 
       present in some cases. 
       e.g., "dolores double studio:double studio:bedroom 1:bed"
