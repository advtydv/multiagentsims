# Information Asymmetry Simulation - Bug Fixes and Improvements Summary

## Major Feature Addition: Multiple Actions Per Turn

### Implementation Details
**Files Modified**: `simulation/agent.py`, `simulation/simulation.py`

Agents can now take multiple actions in a single turn, including:
- Sending messages to multiple agents
- Requesting information from one agent while sharing with another
- Sending information to multiple recipients
- Submitting a task and continuing to help others
- Any strategic combination of actions

The agent prompt now explicitly explains this capability with examples, and the JSON format has been updated to use an `actions` array.

## Bugs Fixed

### 1. Information Directory Not Updating After Transfers (CRITICAL)
**Fixed in**: `simulation/tasks.py` and `simulation/simulation.py`
- Added `transfer_information()` method to InformationManager
- Updated `_process_information_transfer()` to call this method after successful transfers
- Now the information directory accurately reflects real-time information distribution

### 2. Agent's Information Tracking Property Initialization
**Fixed in**: `simulation/agent.py` and `simulation/simulation.py`
- Modified Agent constructor to accept `all_info_pieces` parameter
- Pass information pieces during agent initialization instead of setting after creation
- Prevents AttributeError when tracking requests

### 3. Duplicate Information Sending Prevention
**Fixed in**: `simulation/agent.py`
- Added validation in `_parse_action()` to check for duplicate sends
- Filters out already-sent information pieces before processing
- Logs when duplicates are avoided

### 4. Real-time Information Directory Updates
**Fixed in**: `simulation/simulation.py`
- Added initial sync between agents and InformationManager after initialization
- Ensures the directory is accurate from the start

### 5. Race Condition in Request Tracking
**Fixed in**: `simulation/agent.py`
- Added null check for `_all_info_pieces` before using it
- Prevents crashes when tracking information requests

### 6. Information Validation Before Task Submission
**Fixed in**: `simulation/simulation.py`
- Added consistency check between agent's local state and InformationManager
- Syncs any discrepancies before validating task submission
- Logs warnings when mismatches are detected

### 7. System Messages Separation
**Fixed in**: `simulation/communication.py`
- Added separate storage for system messages
- System notifications no longer mixed with agent communications
- Added `get_system_messages()` method for retrieving system notifications

## Impact

These fixes ensure:
- Agents have accurate, real-time information about who has what
- No duplicate information transfers waste agent actions
- Consistent state between agents and the simulation manager
- Better debugging through improved logging
- More robust error handling and validation

## Testing Recommendations

1. Run simulations with verbose logging to verify information transfers are tracked correctly
2. Check that agents no longer send duplicate information
3. Verify the information directory updates in real-time after transfers
4. Ensure system messages don't interfere with agent decision-making
5. Test edge cases like simultaneous transfers and rapid information exchanges
