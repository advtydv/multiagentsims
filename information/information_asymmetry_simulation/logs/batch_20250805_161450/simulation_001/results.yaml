        calculations, and agent_9 requires the Region 20 market data for analysis.

        metrics. Although I previously sent requests to agents 7, 4, 1, and 8 for

        the Department 7 budget with a lower quality score will suffice because it
        is the mandatory piece. I have thoroughly reviewed all the pieces and they
