      content: I still need the Product 18 performance metrics and Q13 sales data
        for my task. I have asked multiple times but have not received them yet. Please
        send them to me to validate the budget.
      private_thoughts: Agent_3 has ignored my requests 4 times already, but they
        are the only ones with Product 18 performance metrics besides me. I will ask
        again once more before deciding to escalate or find alternatives.
