        data for budget validation. Even though these data points are not directly
        required for my forecast, sharing them helps me build goodwill and secure

        requested some information which influences my choices now. I chose to approach
        agent_3 for Q11 sales data since their directory includes this, and they are
        one of the higher-ranked agents which may add credibility to the data. Agent_4

        for the Region 13 market data because they are a top-ranked agent and likely
        have high-quality data, but I must be prepared for potential negotiation given
        their standing. For the Department 24 budget, agent_4 is a sensible choice
        since I have already exchanged information with them and it helps build cooperative
        momentum. Finally, I target agent_9 for the Department 9 budget, as they hold
        this piece and are lower ranked compared to some other agents, which minimizes

        the 'Department 9 budget', both agent_7 and agent_9 have it listed, but since
        I have an outstanding request with agent_7 for 'Customer segment 27 analysis',
        I prefer not to overload her with additional queries. I will therefore approach

        asked for the Department 24 budget, while agent_2 also requires Region 14
        market data for their quarterly revenue calculation. Additionally, agent_8
        needs Q2 sales data for her trend analysis. By addressing these pending requests,
        I aim to build goodwill and ensure smoother future exchanges. I am balancing
        between optimizing my task outcome and strategically sharing data to enhance

        pieces. At the same time, I need to be a collaborative team member and address
        the pending requests from other agents. Agent_8 requested our Product 4 performance
        metrics for forecast analysis, and I have it available so I am sharing it.
        Additionally, agent_5 requested Region 38 market data, which I also possess
        and thus share with them. I am ensuring that all relevant requests are fulfilled
        while maximizing efficiency in completing my own task. This strategic inclusion

        to reach out to agent_5 since they have this information available according
        to our directory. Although agent_5 is top-ranked and might be a bit more selective,
        the mutual benefit of data exchange in our work community encourages cooperation.
