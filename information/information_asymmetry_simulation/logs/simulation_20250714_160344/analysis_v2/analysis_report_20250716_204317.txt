  - messages_per_agent: 14.200
  - broadcast_ratio: 0.000
  - response_rate: 0.507
  - avg_conversation_length: 2.312
  - network_density: 0.850
  - reciprocity: 0.824
  - clustering_coefficient: 1.000

Summary:
Communication analysis reveals 71 messages exchanged 
between agents, averaging 14.2 messages per agent.

The network shows 85.0% density with 
82.4% reciprocity rate. The clustering coefficient 
of 1.00 indicates 
tight 
communication clusters.

The dominant communication strategy is "Balanced Communicator" used by 
3 agents. Broadcast messages account for 
0.0% of all communications.

Average conversation length is 2.3 messages,
with a response rate of 50.7%.


Information Flow Analysis Summary
==================================

Key Metrics:
  - total_info_shared: 29

  - centralization: 0.440
  - overall_truthfulness: 1.000
  - deception_rate: 0.000
  - trust_variance: 0.000

Summary:
Information flow analysis shows 29 pieces of 
information shared across the network, averaging 1.2 
pieces per exchange.

The network exhibits a Gini coefficient of 0.239, 
indicating moderate 
inequality in information distribution. The asymmetry index of 
0.517 shows 
significant 
directional bias in exchanges.

Trust metrics reveal 100.0% truthfulness rate 
with 0.0% of exchanges containing false information. 
Trust variance of 0.000 indicates 
consistent 
trustworthiness across agents.

The network has 3 central broker(s) facilitating information flow. 
The hoarding index of 0.063 suggests 
balanced sharing 
behavior.

Summary:
Task performance analysis reveals 100.0% 
overall success rate with 100.0% of 
possible bonuses captured.

Competitive dynamics show moderate 
first-mover advantage (0.0%) with 
average competition intensity of 0.0%.

Top performers sent 13.3 
messages on average and shared 5.7 
information pieces, capturing 100.0% 
of bonuses.

Efficiency metrics show:
- Overall: 1.00 tasks/round
- Action: 9.5% success per action
- Time: 41.1% time efficiency
- Resource: 0.34 tasks per info received

with 0 successful negotiation chains leading 
to information exchanges.

Deception is present in 0.0% of information 
exchanges, with 0 
agents employing some form of deceptive strategy.

Reciprocity analysis shows an overall score of 0.52, 
with 8 strongly reciprocal agent pairs identified.

Strategy diversity index is 0.60, indicating 
moderate
