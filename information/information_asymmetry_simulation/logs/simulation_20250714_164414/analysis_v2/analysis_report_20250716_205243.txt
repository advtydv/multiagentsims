  - messages_per_agent: 9.333
  - broadcast_ratio: 0.028
  - response_rate: 0.607
  - avg_conversation_length: 2.545
  - network_density: 0.600
  - reciprocity: 0.889
  - clustering_coefficient: 1.000

Summary:
Communication analysis reveals 56 messages exchanged 
between agents, averaging 9.3 messages per agent.

The network shows 60.0% density with 
88.9% reciprocity rate. The clustering coefficient 
of 1.00 indicates 
tight 
communication clusters.

The dominant communication strategy is "Balanced Communicator" used by 
4 agents. Broadcast messages account for 
2.8% of all communications.

Average conversation length is 2.5 messages,
with a response rate of 60.7%.


Information Flow Analysis Summary
==================================

Key Metrics:
  - total_info_shared: 20

  - centralization: 0.400
  - overall_truthfulness: 1.000
  - deception_rate: 0.000
  - trust_variance: 0.000

Summary:
Information flow analysis shows 20 pieces of 
information shared across the network, averaging 1.2 
pieces per exchange.

The network exhibits a Gini coefficient of 0.208, 
indicating moderate 
inequality in information distribution. The asymmetry index of 
0.753 shows 
significant 
directional bias in exchanges.

Trust metrics reveal 100.0% truthfulness rate 
with 0.0% of exchanges containing false information. 
Trust variance of 0.000 indicates 
consistent 
trustworthiness across agents.

The network has 3 central broker(s) facilitating information flow. 
The hoarding index of 0.055 suggests 
balanced sharing 
behavior.

overall success rate with 100.0% of 
possible bonuses captured.

Competitive dynamics show strong 
first-mover advantage (inf%) with 
average competition intensity of 0.0%.

Top performers sent 8.3 
messages on average and shared 3.3 
information pieces, capturing 100.0% 
of bonuses.

Efficiency metrics show:
- Overall: 1.00 tasks/round

with 0 successful negotiation chains leading 
to information exchanges.

Deception is present in 0.0% of information 
exchanges, with 0 
agents employing some form of deceptive strategy.

Reciprocity analysis shows an overall score of 0.20, 
with 6 strongly reciprocal agent pairs identified.

Strategy diversity index is 0.67, indicating 
moderate
