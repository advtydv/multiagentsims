Communication Patterns Analysis Summary
========================================

Key Metrics:
  - total_messages: 125
  - messages_per_agent: 12.500
  - broadcast_ratio: 0.000
  - response_rate: 0.456
  - avg_conversation_length: 2.308
  - network_density: 0.722
  - reciprocity: 0.708
  - clustering_coefficient: 0.932

Summary:
Communication analysis reveals 125 messages exchanged 
between agents, averaging 12.5 messages per agent.

The network shows 72.2% density with 
70.8% reciprocity rate. The clustering coefficient 
of 0.93 indicates 
tight 
communication clusters.

The dominant communication strategy is "Balanced Communicator" used by 
9 agents. Broadcast messages account for 
0.0% of all communications.

Average conversation length is 2.3 messages,
with a response rate of 45.6%.


Information Flow Analysis Summary
==================================

  - centralization: 0.210
  - overall_truthfulness: 1.000
  - deception_rate: 0.000
  - trust_variance: 0.000

Summary:
Information flow analysis shows 97 pieces of 
information shared across the network, averaging 1.1 
pieces per exchange.

The network exhibits a Gini coefficient of 0.238, 
indicating moderate 
inequality in information distribution. The asymmetry index of 
0.537 shows 
significant 
directional bias in exchanges.

Trust metrics reveal 100.0% truthfulness rate 
with 0.0% of exchanges containing false information. 
Trust variance of 0.000 indicates 
consistent 
trustworthiness across agents.

The network has 10 central broker(s) facilitating information flow. 
The hoarding index of 0.005 suggests 
balanced sharing 
behavior.

with 0 successful negotiation chains leading 
to information exchanges.

Deception is present in 0.0% of information 
exchanges, with 0 
agents employing some form of deceptive strategy.

Reciprocity analysis shows an overall score of 0.38, 
with 26 strongly reciprocal agent pairs identified.
