SIMULATION OVERVIEW
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Agents: 5
Rounds: 10
Total Information Pieces: 20


Communication Patterns Analysis Summary
========================================

Key Metrics:
  - total_messages: 37
  - messages_per_agent: 7.400
  - broadcast_ratio: 0.000
  - response_rate: 0.351
  - avg_conversation_length: 2.333
  - network_density: 0.700
  - reciprocity: 0.714
  - clustering_coefficient: 0.900

Summary:
Communication analysis reveals 37 messages exchanged 
between agents, averaging 7.4 messages per agent.

The network shows 70.0% density with 
71.4% reciprocity rate. The clustering coefficient 
of 0.90 indicates 
tight 
communication clusters.

The dominant communication strategy is "Focused Partner" used by 
2 agents. Broadcast messages account for 
0.0% of all communications.

Average conversation length is 2.3 messages,
with a response rate of 35.1%.


Information Flow Analysis Summary
==================================

Key Metrics:
  - total_info_shared: 8
  - avg_info_per_exchange: 1.143
  - sharing_rate: 1.400
  - reciprocal_sharing_rate: 0.500
  - hoarding_index: 0.167
  - gini_coefficient: 0.167
  - asymmetry_index: 0.667
  - centralization: 0.375
  - overall_truthfulness: 1.000
  - deception_rate: 0.000
  - trust_variance: 0.000

Summary:
Information flow analysis shows 8 pieces of 
information shared across the network, averaging 1.1 
pieces per exchange.

The network exhibits a Gini coefficient of 0.167, 
indicating moderate 
inequality in information distribution. The asymmetry index of 
0.667 shows 
significant 
directional bias in exchanges.

Trust metrics reveal 100.0% truthfulness rate 
with 0.0% of exchanges containing false information. 
Trust variance of 0.000 indicates 
consistent 
trustworthiness across agents.

The network has 2 central broker(s) facilitating information flow. 
The hoarding index of 0.167 suggests 
balanced sharing 
behavior.

  - action_efficiency: 0.020
  - time_efficiency: 0.667
  - resource_efficiency: 0.125
  - first_mover_advantage: inf

Summary:
Task performance analysis reveals 20.0% 
overall success rate with 100.0% of 
possible bonuses captured.

Competitive dynamics show strong 
first-mover advantage (inf%) with 
average competition intensity of 0.0%.

Top performers sent 7.7 
messages on average and shared 2.3 
information pieces, capturing 100.0% 
of bonuses.

Efficiency metrics show:
- Overall: 0.10 tasks/round
- Action: 2.0% success per action
- Time: 66.7% time efficiency
- Resource: 0.12 tasks per info received

Tasks are completed on average in round 4.0.

====================================

Key Metrics:
  - negotiation_frequency: 0.459
  - deception_prevalence: 0.000
  - reciprocity_score: 0.150
  - strategy_diversity: 0.400

Summary:
Strategic behavior analysis reveals diverse approaches with "Information Broker" 
as the most common strategy (3 agents).

Negotiation occurs in 45.9% of messages, 
with 1 successful negotiation chains leading 
to information exchanges.

Deception is present in 0.0% of information 
exchanges, with 0 
agents employing some form of deceptive strategy.

Reciprocity analysis shows an overall score of 0.15, 
with 2 strongly reciprocal agent pairs identified.

Strategy diversity index is 0.40, indicating 
moderate 
behavioral diversity in the simulation.
