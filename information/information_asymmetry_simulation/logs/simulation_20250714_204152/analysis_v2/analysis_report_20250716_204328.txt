SIMULATION OVERVIEW
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Agents: 10
Rounds: 10
Total Information Pieces: 40


Communication Patterns Analysis Summary
========================================

Key Metrics:
  - total_messages: 133
  - messages_per_agent: 12.091
  - broadcast_ratio: 0.016
  - response_rate: 0.421
  - avg_conversation_length: 2.542
  - network_density: 0.482
  - reciprocity: 0.604
  - clustering_coefficient: 0.836

Summary:
Communication analysis reveals 133 messages exchanged 
between agents, averaging 12.1 messages per agent.

The network shows 48.2% density with 
60.4% reciprocity rate. The clustering coefficient 
of 0.84 indicates 
tight 
communication clusters.

The dominant communication strategy is "Balanced Communicator" used by 
9 agents. Broadcast messages account for 
1.6% of all communications.

Average conversation length is 2.5 messages,
with a response rate of 42.1%.


Information Flow Analysis Summary
==================================

Key Metrics:
  - total_info_shared: 55
  - avg_info_per_exchange: 1.058

  - centralization: 0.200
  - overall_truthfulness: 1.000
  - deception_rate: 0.000
  - trust_variance: 0.000

Summary:
Information flow analysis shows 55 pieces of 
information shared across the network, averaging 1.1 
pieces per exchange.

The network exhibits a Gini coefficient of 0.194, 
indicating moderate 
inequality in information distribution. The asymmetry index of 
0.699 shows 
significant 
directional bias in exchanges.

Trust metrics reveal 100.0% truthfulness rate 
with 0.0% of exchanges containing false information. 
Trust variance of 0.000 indicates 
consistent 
trustworthiness across agents.

The network has 8 central broker(s) facilitating information flow. 
The hoarding index of 0.027 suggests 
balanced sharing 
behavior.

  - action_efficiency: 0.111
  - time_efficiency: 0.459
  - resource_efficiency: 0.418
  - first_mover_advantage: inf

Summary:
Task performance analysis reveals 100.0% 
overall success rate with 100.0% of 
possible bonuses captured.

Competitive dynamics show strong 
first-mover advantage (inf%) with 
average competition intensity of 0.0%.

Top performers sent 12.7 
messages on average and shared 4.7 
information pieces, capturing 100.0% 
of bonuses.

Efficiency metrics show:
- Overall: 2.30 tasks/round
- Action: 11.1% success per action
- Time: 45.9% time efficiency
- Resource: 0.42 tasks per info received

Tasks are completed on average in round 5.9.


Strategic Behavior Analysis Summary
====================================

Key Metrics:
  - negotiation_frequency: 0.158
  - deception_prevalence: 0.000
  - reciprocity_score: 0.161
  - strategy_diversity: 0.273

Summary:
Strategic behavior analysis reveals diverse approaches with "Information Broker" 
as the most common strategy (7 agents).

Negotiation occurs in 15.8% of messages, 
with 4 successful negotiation chains leading 
to information exchanges.

Deception is present in 0.0% of information 
exchanges, with 0 
agents employing some form of deceptive strategy.

Reciprocity analysis shows an overall score of 0.16, 
with 14 strongly reciprocal agent pairs identified.

Strategy diversity index is 0.27, indicating 
moderate 
behavioral diversity in the simulation.

KEY INSIGHTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
â€¢ Strong correlation between early action and success indicates first-mover advantages are significant
