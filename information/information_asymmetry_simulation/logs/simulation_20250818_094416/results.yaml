        Department 31 budget (already owned). The two agents with the first two needed
        pieces have already contacted me requesting items I possess. Agent_6 wants
        Product 1 performance metrics and can give Department 16 budget, which perfectly
        aligns, so I propose simultaneous trade instead of sending info outright;
        risk mitigation to avoid non-reciprocation. Product 1 metrics is reasonably
        valuable but I can still share it while retaining copy, ensuring goodwill.
        Agent_10 is willing to give Customer segment 20 analysis; they want Department
        31 budget and Product 1 metrics. Since I expect to use Product 1 for agent_6
        trade, I will offer the low-quality Department 31 budget first, asking for
        Customer segment 20 analysis. Even if they refuse, I can later decide to share
        Product 1 metrics after obtaining Dept 16 from agent_6. For Product 4 performance
        metrics, only agent_4 holds it, so I proactively reach out offering my highest-quality
        asset, Department 11 budget, to incentivize them. No information is sent yet
        to keep negotiation leverage and avoid losing data without gaining. Plan next

        \ 16 budget: agent_4 carries it and hasn\u2019t publicly committed it elsewhere.\
        \ Offering Q29 (v91) should appear lucrative given Dept 16\u2019s lower value\
        \ (~20). Even if they refuse extra throw-ins, I only really need Dept 16;\
        \ anything additional is upside for revenue.\n2. Product 6 metrics: agent_5\
        \ definitely has them and is actively searching for Product 40. By courting\
        \ agent_8 for Product 40 first (they have it and already owe me goodwill after\
        \ I fronted them two valuable pieces), I can play middle-man. If agent_8 agrees,\
        \ I\u2019ll immediately swap that to agent_5 for Product 6, possibly with\
        \ a sweetener.\n3. Customer segment 3 analysis: only agent_3 owns it. They\
        \ already refused a one-for-one, so I\u2019m upping the ante\u2014offering\
        \ both Region 32 (v78) and Q29 (v91) for it. That\u2019s massive value (169)\

        \ use those two assets to complete their own work or bolster revenue.\n4.\
