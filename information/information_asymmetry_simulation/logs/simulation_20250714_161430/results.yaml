      private_thoughts: I have Product 11 performance metrics but I need Product 15
        performance metrics, Region 20 market data, and Region 10 market data to complete
        my task. According to the directory, agent_5 has all these pieces of information.
        I requested these from agent_5. Once I receive them, I can combine all data
        and submit my task. I chose not to request from multiple agents to reduce
        communication overhead and because agent_5 has all required data. I will wait
        for their response, and meanwhile, I am ready to assist others if asked.

        agent_4 for Product 19 performance metrics, and agent_5 for Region 10 market
        data. I did not send any information this round since no one requested from
        me yet. My plan is to gather all needed data as soon as possible to complete
        and submit the task in the next round. I noticed that the required data is

        required for my analysis. This is to make sure I have the most updated or
