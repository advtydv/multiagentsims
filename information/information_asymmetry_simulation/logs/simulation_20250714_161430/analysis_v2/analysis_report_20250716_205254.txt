  - messages_per_agent: 10.600
  - broadcast_ratio: 0.000
  - response_rate: 0.736
  - avg_conversation_length: 2.462
  - network_density: 0.900
  - reciprocity: 1.000
  - clustering_coefficient: 0.900

Summary:
Communication analysis reveals 53 messages exchanged 
between agents, averaging 10.6 messages per agent.

The network shows 90.0% density with 
100.0% reciprocity rate. The clustering coefficient 
of 0.90 indicates 
tight 
communication clusters.

The dominant communication strategy is "Networker" used by 
3 agents. Broadcast messages account for 
0.0% of all communications.

Average conversation length is 2.5 messages,
with a response rate of 73.6%.

  - centralization: 0.397
  - overall_truthfulness: 1.000
  - deception_rate: 0.000
  - trust_variance: 0.000

Summary:
Information flow analysis shows 29 pieces of 
information shared across the network, averaging 1.4 
pieces per exchange.

The network exhibits a Gini coefficient of 0.239, 
indicating moderate 
inequality in information distribution. The asymmetry index of 
0.467 shows 
balanced 
directional bias in exchanges.

Trust metrics reveal 100.0% truthfulness rate 
with 0.0% of exchanges containing false information. 
Trust variance of 0.000 indicates 
consistent 
trustworthiness across agents.

The network has 5 central broker(s) facilitating information flow. 
The hoarding index of 0.002 suggests 
balanced sharing 
behavior.

with 0 successful negotiation chains leading 
to information exchanges.

Deception is present in 0.0% of information 
exchanges, with 0 
agents employing some form of deceptive strategy.

Reciprocity analysis shows an overall score of 0.70, 
with 14 strongly reciprocal agent pairs identified.

Strategy diversity index is 0.40, indicating
