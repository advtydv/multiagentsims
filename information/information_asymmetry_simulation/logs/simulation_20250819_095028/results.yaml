        \ so I made a premium offer (D2 89 + P38 85, with Q21 78 bonus) to maximize\
        \ acceptance. As redundancy, I offered agent_7 a strong 3-for-3 package for\
        \ the same three items (D23 78 + P5 79 + Q21 78, with Q32 63 sweetener), since\
        \ they also have all three. To hedge further, I split fallback paths: agent_1\
        \ for R31 + P11 (offering D23 + Q21 + optional Q32) and separately asked agents\
        \ 8, 6, and 3 for Q10 (offering Q20 + Q32 or P5). I declined agent_2\u2019\
        s Q8-for-D24 since I need Q8 to submit. The broadcast is to create urgency\
        \ and attract any holder to send immediately. Strategy: overpay to ensure\
        \ fast reciprocation and secure all missing pieces this round, then submit\
        \ the task as soon as the items arrive."
