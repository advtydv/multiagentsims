SIMULATION OVERVIEW
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Agents: 5
Rounds: 10
Total Information Pieces: 20


Communication Patterns Analysis Summary
========================================

Key Metrics:
  - total_messages: 60
  - messages_per_agent: 12.000
  - broadcast_ratio: 0.000
  - response_rate: 0.750
  - avg_conversation_length: 3.800
  - network_density: 0.750
  - reciprocity: 0.800
  - clustering_coefficient: 0.900

Summary:
Communication analysis reveals 60 messages exchanged 
between agents, averaging 12.0 messages per agent.

The network shows 75.0% density with 
80.0% reciprocity rate. The clustering coefficient 
of 0.90 indicates 
tight 
communication clusters.

The dominant communication strategy is "Balanced Communicator" used by 
3 agents. Broadcast messages account for 
0.0% of all communications.

Average conversation length is 3.8 messages,
with a response rate of 75.0%.


Information Flow Analysis Summary
==================================

Key Metrics:
  - total_info_shared: 18
  - avg_info_per_exchange: 1.125

  - reciprocal_sharing_rate: 0.625
  - hoarding_index: 0.022
  - gini_coefficient: 0.205
  - asymmetry_index: 0.483
  - centralization: 0.583
  - overall_truthfulness: 1.000
  - deception_rate: 0.000
  - trust_variance: 0.000

Summary:
Information flow analysis shows 18 pieces of 
information shared across the network, averaging 1.1 
pieces per exchange.

The network exhibits a Gini coefficient of 0.205, 
indicating moderate 
inequality in information distribution. The asymmetry index of 
0.483 shows 
balanced 
directional bias in exchanges.

Trust metrics reveal 100.0% truthfulness rate 
with 0.0% of exchanges containing false information. 
Trust variance of 0.000 indicates 
consistent 
trustworthiness across agents.

The network has 2 central broker(s) facilitating information flow. 
The hoarding index of 0.022 suggests 
balanced sharing 
behavior.

  - first_mover_advantage: 0.000

Summary:
Task performance analysis reveals 100.0% 
overall success rate with 100.0% of 
possible bonuses captured.

Competitive dynamics show moderate 
first-mover advantage (0.0%) with 
average competition intensity of 0.0%.

Top performers sent 12.0 
messages on average and shared 4.0 
information pieces, capturing 100.0% 
of bonuses.

Efficiency metrics show:
- Overall: 0.80 tasks/round
- Action: 9.5% success per action
- Time: 61.1% time efficiency
- Resource: 0.44 tasks per info received

Tasks are completed on average in round 4.5.

Summary:
Strategic behavior analysis reveals diverse approaches with "Balanced Player" 
as the most common strategy (3 agents).

Negotiation occurs in 53.3% of messages, 
with 2 successful negotiation chains leading 
to information exchanges.

Deception is present in 0.0% of information 
exchanges, with 0 
agents employing some form of deceptive strategy.

Reciprocity analysis shows an overall score of 0.45, 
with 8 strongly reciprocal agent pairs identified.

Strategy diversity index is 0.60, indicating 
moderate 
behavioral diversity in the simulation.
