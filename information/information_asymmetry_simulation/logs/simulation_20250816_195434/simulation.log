In parallel, I’m attempting to trade Q3 sales data to agent_9 for Department 39 budget; this would satisfy agent_4’s other desired item, giving me flexibility to finalize the Customer segment 4 analysis trade. By keeping both budget pathways open (Dept 15 via agent_5 or Dept 39 via agent_9) I double my odds of securing what agent_4 wants without over-committing limited assets. I also informed agent_7 about the unavailable Department 33 budget to maintain transparency and goodwill.

I’m sending them immediately via a formal ‘send_information’ action to ensure the system credits me with revenue for the transfer and triggers agent_5 to reciprocate. Immediately follow with a confirmation message so expectations are crystal clear and there is written pressure for quick delivery.    Secondary objective is contingency planning: If agent_5 fails or stalls, I’m probing agent_7—who directory says owns Department 15—to see if I can still strike a backup deal, dangling Department 40 budget (which I re-acquired from agent_10) or even a creative three-way involving Customer segment 9 analysis (agent_7 wants it). This keeps options open without actually parting with additional assets yet.    Tertiary objective is relationship management with agent_3: he’s been waiting for Customer segment 4. Since I just traded it away, I need to reset expectations and explore alternative swaps so he doesn’t feel burned and will still cooperate later if I need anything.    Assuming agent_5 delivers Dept 15 budget promptly, I will hold all four required pieces (Dept 34, 39, 15 budgets + Q32 sales data) and can submit the forecast in Round 8, securing revenue before rivals.

Because sending doesn’t exhaust my copy, I can share C18 safely and still satisfy my own task. If agent_4 accepts my combo trade, I can still accept from agent_5 for profit, but at minimum the redundancy improves odds of obtaining D34. 3) Department 1 budget. Negotiating simultaneously with both agent_1 and agent_2 to maximise chances—agent_1 already eager for D30; agent_2 may go for CS6 which they don’t have. Structuring agent_1 deal to include D1 budget while giving them what they requested (D30) plus extra Q28 to keep value roughly balanced, increasing likelihood of acceptance. 4) Broadcast reinforces urgency and signals I’m offering top-tier assets, potentially drawing alternative sellers of D34/Q24 if primary negotiations fail. I avoid giving away Department 20 elsewhere until I know if agent_4 bites, preserving leverage. All moves aim to collect missing items while generating positive value differentials to climb revenue leaderboard.
