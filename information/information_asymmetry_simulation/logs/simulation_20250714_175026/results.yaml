      private_thoughts: I need to analyze trends by comparing Region 15 market data,

        but I'm missing Product 1 and Product 4. The directory indicates that agent_4
        possesses these pieces, so I'm requesting them from agent_4. My strategy is
        to secure all required information before the final submission and maintain
        active collaborations with other agents, while also managing repeated requests
        with agent_1 that haven't been resolved yet. Future rounds, I'll follow up

        all the necessary data (I already hold Product 14 performance metrics) and
        will be ready to submit the completed task in an upcoming round. This approach

        Since my previous requests to agent_1 haven't yielded a response, I'm reaching
