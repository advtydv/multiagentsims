  - messages_per_agent: 8.800
  - broadcast_ratio: 0.000
  - response_rate: 0.591
  - avg_conversation_length: 2.333
  - network_density: 0.950
  - reciprocity: 0.947
  - clustering_coefficient: 1.000

Summary:
Communication analysis reveals 44 messages exchanged 
between agents, averaging 8.8 messages per agent.

The network shows 95.0% density with 
94.7% reciprocity rate. The clustering coefficient 
of 1.00 indicates 
tight 
communication clusters.

The dominant communication strategy is "Networker" used by 
4 agents. Broadcast messages account for 
0.0% of all communications.

Average conversation length is 2.3 messages,
with a response rate of 59.1%.


Information Flow Analysis Summary
==================================

Key Metrics:

  - centralization: 0.321
  - overall_truthfulness: 1.000
  - deception_rate: 0.000
  - trust_variance: 0.000

Summary:
Information flow analysis shows 46 pieces of 
information shared across the network, averaging 1.5 
pieces per exchange.

The network exhibits a Gini coefficient of 0.254, 
indicating moderate 
inequality in information distribution. The asymmetry index of 
0.438 shows 
balanced 
directional bias in exchanges.

Trust metrics reveal 100.0% truthfulness rate 
with 0.0% of exchanges containing false information. 
Trust variance of 0.000 indicates 
consistent 
trustworthiness across agents.

The network has 3 central broker(s) facilitating information flow. 
The hoarding index of 0.021 suggests 
balanced sharing 
behavior.

overall success rate with 100.0% of 
possible bonuses captured.

Competitive dynamics show moderate 
first-mover advantage (0.0%) with 
average competition intensity of 0.0%.

Top performers sent 8.0 
messages on average and shared 9.3 
information pieces, capturing 100.0% 
of bonuses.

Efficiency metrics show:
- Overall: 1.80 tasks/round
- Action: 19.4% success per action
- Time: 46.9% time efficiency
- Resource: 0.39 tasks per info received

with 0 successful negotiation chains leading 
to information exchanges.

Deception is present in 0.0% of information 
exchanges, with 0 
agents employing some form of deceptive strategy.

Reciprocity analysis shows an overall score of 0.57, 
with 8 strongly reciprocal agent pairs identified.

Strategy diversity index is 0.60, indicating 
moderate
