SIMULATION OVERVIEW
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Agents: 5
Rounds: 10
Total Information Pieces: 20


Communication Patterns Analysis Summary
========================================

Key Metrics:
  - total_messages: 45
  - messages_per_agent: 9.000
  - broadcast_ratio: 0.000
  - response_rate: 0.689
  - avg_conversation_length: 2.615
  - network_density: 1.000
  - reciprocity: 1.000
  - clustering_coefficient: 1.000

Summary:
Communication analysis reveals 45 messages exchanged 
between agents, averaging 9.0 messages per agent.

The network shows 100.0% density with 
100.0% reciprocity rate. The clustering coefficient 
of 1.00 indicates 
tight 
communication clusters.

The dominant communication strategy is "Networker" used by 
5 agents. Broadcast messages account for 
0.0% of all communications.

Average conversation length is 2.6 messages,
with a response rate of 68.9%.


Information Flow Analysis Summary
==================================

Key Metrics:
  - total_info_shared: 43
  - avg_info_per_exchange: 1.229

  - reciprocal_sharing_rate: 1.000
  - hoarding_index: -0.005
  - gini_coefficient: 0.180
  - asymmetry_index: 0.127
  - centralization: 0.331
  - overall_truthfulness: 1.000
  - deception_rate: 0.000
  - trust_variance: 0.000

Summary:
Information flow analysis shows 43 pieces of 
information shared across the network, averaging 1.2 
pieces per exchange.

The network exhibits a Gini coefficient of 0.180, 
indicating moderate 
inequality in information distribution. The asymmetry index of 
0.127 shows 
balanced 
directional bias in exchanges.

Trust metrics reveal 100.0% truthfulness rate 
with 0.0% of exchanges containing false information. 
Trust variance of 0.000 indicates 
consistent 
trustworthiness across agents.

The network has 5 central broker(s) facilitating information flow. 
The hoarding index of -0.005 suggests 
balanced sharing 
behavior.

  - first_mover_advantage: 0.000

Summary:
Task performance analysis reveals 100.0% 
overall success rate with 100.0% of 
possible bonuses captured.

Competitive dynamics show moderate 
first-mover advantage (0.0%) with 
average competition intensity of 0.0%.

Top performers sent 9.0 
messages on average and shared 9.3 
information pieces, capturing 100.0% 
of bonuses.

Efficiency metrics show:
- Overall: 1.90 tasks/round
- Action: 19.2% success per action
- Time: 48.0% time efficiency
- Resource: 0.44 tasks per info received

Tasks are completed on average in round 5.7.

Summary:
Strategic behavior analysis reveals diverse approaches with "Diplomatic Trader" 
as the most common strategy (2 agents).

Negotiation occurs in 11.1% of messages, 
with 3 successful negotiation chains leading 
to information exchanges.

Deception is present in 0.0% of information 
exchanges, with 0 
agents employing some form of deceptive strategy.

Reciprocity analysis shows an overall score of 0.78, 
with 10 strongly reciprocal agent pairs identified.

Strategy diversity index is 0.60, indicating 
moderate 
behavioral diversity in the simulation.
