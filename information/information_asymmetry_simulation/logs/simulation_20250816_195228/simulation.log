To make the offer compelling, I highlight my highest-quality asset (Customer segment 26 analysis, quality 85, value 99) and also mention Region 36 market data, giving potential partners flexibility depending on their needs. By not sending the information outright, I preserve its value and avoid giving away revenue for free. The broadcast helps reach any other agent who may have duplicate copies of the required items or be willing to broker a multi-party trade, increasing my chances of success this round. If any of them respond positively, I’ll evaluate which asset to relinquish, balancing revenue generation against completing my task quickly. I avoid unnecessary outbound data transfers this turn to maintain negotiation leverage and protect my revenue potential.
