Department 29 budget is much higher value/quality, so I\u2019m reserving it as a premium bargaining chip; I dangled it indirectly in the broadcast and in my reply to agent_5 to entice broader interest while still controlling the negotiation. By responding politely to agent_5 and setting conditions, I maintain rapport and potentially turn them into an intermediary who acquires what I need. Broadcasting simultaneously increases exposure, accelerating chances of multi-party trades. I avoided sending information this round to preserve leverage until I secure commitments. In subsequent rounds, if these agents stall, I may escalate by offering Department 29 or bundling multiple pieces, but for now the aim is to test market appetite while keeping my strongest asset in reserve.
