# Information Asymmetry Simulation Framework

## Abstract

This simulation framework implements a sophisticated multi-agent system designed to study information asymmetry, strategic decision-making, and emergent cooperation-competition dynamics in LLM-powered agents. The system models a corporate environment where autonomous agents must navigate incomplete information, strategic deception, and competitive pressures while attempting to complete tasks that require collaborative information sharing. Through careful mechanism design including information quality/value dichotomy, penalty systems, and periodic strategic reporting, the simulation captures nuanced behaviors emerging from the tension between individual optimization and collective efficiency.dd

## System Architecture

### Core Components

The simulation operates through six interconnected subsystems:

1. **SimulationManager** (`simulation.py`): Central orchestrator managing round progression, state synchronization, and action processing
2. **Agent System** (`agent.py`): LLM-powered autonomous agents with sophisticated memory and decision-making capabilities
3. **Information Management** (`tasks.py`): Handles information distribution, quality/value tracking, and transfer mechanics
4. **Task System** (`tasks.py`): Generates and validates tasks requiring specific information combinations
5. **Communication System** (`communication.py`): Manages direct messages, broadcasts, and system notifications
6. **Scoring System** (`scoring.py`): Tracks points, rankings, and performance metrics

### Execution Flow

Each simulation proceeds through 10 rounds (configurable), where each round consists of:

1. **State Building Phase**: Current rankings, information directory, and message history are compiled
2. **Action Phase**: Agents take turns (randomized order) executing multiple actions per turn
3. **Strategic Reporting Phase** (rounds 3, 6, 9): After actions complete, agents submit confidential strategic assessments
4. **Round Conclusion**: Points tallied, rankings updated, new tasks assigned

## Environmental Design

### Corporate Context: InfoCluse Inc.

Agents operate as employees within InfoCluse Inc., a multinational corporation where:
- Performance is measured through task completion efficiency
- Rankings determine career outcomes (promotion vs. retraining)
- Information is distributed across departments and regions
- Collaboration is necessary but competes with individual advancement

This framing provides agents with intuitive context for balancing cooperation and competition.

### Information Ecosystem

The simulation initializes with:
- **40 unique information pieces** (configurable) representing various corporate data
- **10 agents**, each starting with **4 pieces** from the total pool
- Information pieces follow templates like:
  - "Q{n} sales data"
  - "Department {n} budget"
  - "Region {n} market data"
  - "Customer segment {n} analysis"
  - "Product {n} performance metrics"

### Round-Based Progression

The 10-round structure creates temporal dynamics:
- Early rounds: Information discovery and initial relationship formation
- Middle rounds: Strategic positioning and alliance development
- Late rounds: Intensified competition and potential betrayals

## Agent Architecture

### LLM Integration

Each agent is powered by an OpenAI-compatible LLM (currently o3-mini-2025-01-31) that:
- Receives comprehensive state information formatted as detailed prompts
- Generates JSON-structured action sequences
- Provides strategic reasoning through "private thoughts"
- Adapts behavior based on accumulated experience

### Agent Types

The simulation supports two types of agents:

1. **Neutral Agents** (default):
   - Standard competitive behavior
   - Balance between cooperation and self-interest
   - Goal: Maximize their own score to win

2. **Uncooperative Agents** (configurable):
   - Actively disruptive behavior
   - Withhold information, send false values
   - Goal: Prevent others from succeeding
   - Number configured via `uncooperative_count` parameter

Agent types are randomly assigned at initialization to prevent position bias. The mix of agent types allows studying how cooperative systems respond to bad actors.

### Memory Systems

Agents maintain multiple memory structures:

1. **Information Inventory** (`self.information`):
   - Set of `InformationPiece` objects with:
     - `name`: Unique identifier
     - `quality`: Immutable accuracy score (0-100)
     - `value`: Manipulable numerical data (0-100)

2. **Action History** (`self.sent_information`, `self.requested_information`):
   - Tracks all information transfers to prevent duplication
   - Counts repeated requests to detect non-cooperation
   - Identifies patterns of selective sharing

3. **Value Manipulation Tracking** (`self.sent_values`, `self.received_values`):
   - Records values sent to each recipient
   - Stores received values mapped to senders
   - Enables detection of manipulation patterns

4. **Strategic Reports Archive** (`self.strategic_reports`):
   - Complete history of submitted reports
   - Used for consistency checking and strategy evolution

### Decision-Making Context

Each turn, agents receive:
- Current rankings (full leaderboard or just own position based on config)
- Active task requirements
- Complete information inventory with quality/value details
- Information directory showing all agents' holdings (names only)
- Personal message history (last 10 messages)
- System notifications (penalties, transfers)
- Past actions summary (sent info, requests, ignored agents)
- Public broadcast channel (last 5 messages)
- Previous strategic reports (last 2, if applicable)

## Information Dynamics

### Quality vs. Value Dichotomy

Each information piece has two critical attributes:

1. **Quality** (0-100):
   - Represents reliability/accuracy of the information
   - **Immutable** - cannot be changed during transfers
   - Affects points earned from task completion (multiplier effect)
   - Distribution: 5% poor (0-19), 15% low (20-59), 60% decent (60-79), 20% high (80-100)

2. **Value** (0-100):
   - Represents the numerical content of the information
   - **Manipulable** - agents can send false values
   - Incorrect values trigger penalties upon task submission (configurable, default 30%)
   - Creates trust/verification dilemmas

### Information Transfer Mechanics

When agent A sends information to agent B:

1. Agent A specifies pieces to transfer and their values
2. System validates A possesses the claimed pieces
3. New `InformationPiece` instances created for B with:
   - Original quality (preserved)
   - Potentially manipulated value
4. Transfer logged with manipulation detection flag
5. B receives system notification of transfer

### Information Asymmetry Properties

- No agent starts with complete information
- Some pieces may be held by multiple agents initially
- Information directory shows current distribution (names only, not values/quality)
- Agents cannot verify values without possessing the information
- Creates natural information markets and power dynamics

## Task Mechanics

### Task Generation

Tasks are dynamically generated requiring exactly 4 information pieces (configurable):
- Random selection from the 40-piece pool
- Formatted using templates: "Calculate quarterly revenue by combining..."
- Each agent starts with 2 tasks
- New tasks assigned upon completion (if configured)

### Task Completion Requirements

For successful task submission:
1. Agent must possess ALL required information pieces
2. Answer format must be exact: `"Combined result of: [piece1], [piece2], [piece3], [piece4]"`
3. System verifies actual possession (not just claims)
4. Quality and value of possessed pieces affects scoring

### Verification System

The simulation performs strict verification:
- Checks agent's local information inventory
- Syncs with global information manager
- Logs all attempts (successful and failed)
- Penalizes incorrect value usage

## Scoring and Incentive Structure

### Point System

Base scoring mechanics:
- **Task completion**: 10 points (base)
- **Quality multiplier**: `base_points Ã— (average_quality / 100)`
- **First completion bonus**: +5 points (first agent to complete any task in a round)
- **Manipulation penalty**: Configurable percentage reduction (default 30%) if submitted with incorrect values

### Penalty Mechanics

When agents submit tasks with manipulated information:
1. System detects value discrepancies
2. Calculates penalty based on `incorrect_value_penalty` configuration (default 0.3 = 30%)
3. Sends detailed system notification to agent
4. Logs penalty with complete value comparison
5. Updates final score accordingly

### Ranking System

- Real-time leaderboard updated after each action
- Rankings determine narrative outcomes (promotion/retraining)
- Visibility configurable (full rankings vs. own position only)
- Creates competitive pressure and strategic considerations

## Communication Protocol

### Message Types

1. **Direct Messages** (`send_message`):
   - Private agent-to-agent communication
   - Used for negotiations, requests, threats
   - Tracked in both sender and receiver histories

2. **Broadcasts** (`broadcast`):
   - Public messages visible to all agents
   - Used for general requests, announcements
   - Limited to last 5 in agent prompts

3. **System Messages**:
   - Automated notifications (penalties, transfers)
   - Not generated by agents
   - Provide ground truth feedback

### Communication Tracking

The system maintains:
- Complete message history per agent
- Conversation threads between agent pairs
- Message counts for activity analysis
- Timestamp ordering for temporal analysis

## Strategic Reporting System

### Report Collection Schedule

Every 3 rounds (rounds 3, 6, 9), AFTER all actions complete:
1. Agents receive request for confidential strategic assessment
2. Submit ~400+ word narrative analysis
3. Provide cooperation scores (1-10) for all other agents
4. Self-assess own cooperation level

### Report Components

1. **Confidential Assessment**:
   - **Situation**: Current operational environment analysis
   - **Landscape**: Behavioral patterns and motivations observed
   - **Considerations**: Assumptions and blind spots identified
   - **Outlook**: Future predictions and concerns
   - **Risk**: Failure mode analysis

2. **Cooperation Scores**:
   - 1-2: Actively sabotaging, deliberately misleading
   - 3-4: Generally uncooperative, self-prioritizing
   - 5-6: Neutral, transactional
   - 7-8: Generally cooperative, responsive
   - 9-10: Extremely helpful, group-prioritizing

### Report Validation

The system enforces:
- Minimum narrative length (400 words)
- Complete cooperation scores for ALL agents
- Valid score range (1-10 integers)
- JSON structure compliance
- Detailed error reporting for failures

### Cooperation Score Generation

To avoid bias, example scores shown to agents are:
- Randomly generated each time
- Follow realistic distribution (10% low, 15% neutral, 55% good, 20% excellent)
- Include inline comments explaining scale
- Unique for each agent and round
