## ðŸŽ“ Usage for Paper

All visualizations are publication-ready at 300 DPI. The findings support:

1. **Main argument**: Closed systems outperform open systems in longer timescales
2. **Model selection**: Moderate-capability models achieve optimal balance
3. **Security insights**: Open systems naturally resilient to bad actors
4. **Design implications**: 15-25% initial information distribution is optimal
5. **Surprising discovery**: Uncooperative agents win in open systems but lose in closed
