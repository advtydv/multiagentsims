# Practical Dashboard Improvements for Information Asymmetry Analysis

## Overview
These improvements focus on extracting meaningful insights from completed simulations without adding complexity. Each enhancement reveals specific patterns in agent behavior and strategic decision-making.

## 1. Missing Key Analyses

### Task Completion Velocity
**What's Missing**: How quickly agents act after getting needed information
**Add**: 
- Time between receiving final required piece and task completion
- Which information pieces are typically the "bottleneck"
- Simple line chart: completion velocity by agent over rounds

### Information Request Success Matrix
**What's Missing**: Which agent pairs communicate effectively
**Add**:
- Heatmap: request success rate between each agent pair
- Response time patterns between specific agents
- Identify selective sharing relationships

### Coalition Detection
**What's Missing**: Implicit groups based on actual sharing behavior
**Add**:
- Detect clusters of agents who share within group but not outside
- Compare coalition vs isolated agent performance
- Track coalition stability across rounds

### Strategic Timing Patterns
**What's Missing**: When agents choose to share vs withhold
**Add**:
- Early vs late game sharing patterns
- Reciprocity delays (rounds between receiving and giving back)
- End-game behavioral changes

### Information Distribution Analysis
**What's Missing**: Which information is over/under-shared
**Add**:
- Distribution count per information piece
- Identify critical vs redundant information
- Calculate information inequality (Gini coefficient)

## 2. Simple Game Theory Metrics

### Prisoner's Dilemma Instances
- Count situations where mutual sharing would benefit both agents but both withheld
- Track frequency across rounds
- Identify which agents fall into this trap most often

### Nash Equilibrium Detection
- Find rounds where no agent could improve by changing strategy alone
- Simple calculation based on current sharing patterns
- Display as timeline markers

### Pareto Efficiency Score
- Calculate if final outcome could be improved for all agents
- Identify wasted opportunities for mutual gain
- Single metric for overall simulation efficiency

### Tit-for-Tat Behavior
- Detect agents whose round N+1 behavior mirrors round N treatment
- Measure strategy effectiveness
- Simple pattern matching on exchange sequences

## 3. Behavioral Insights

### Trust Violation Tracking
- Detect promises in messages ("I'll share X with you")
- Track fulfillment rate
- Identify trust recovery patterns

### Message Efficiency
- Words per successful request
- Success rate of multi-item requests
- ROI of broadcast vs targeted messages

### Performance Attribution
- Correlate behaviors with final ranking
- Simple scatter plots: behavior metric vs points
- Identify which strategies actually work

### Information Arbitrage
- Count exclusive information per agent
- Identify broker positions in network
- Measure if brokers achieve higher scores

### Simple Calculations to Add

```python
# Example: Information to Task Latency
def calculate_info_to_task_latency(events, agent_id):
    info_received = {}  # track when each piece received
    latencies = []
    
    for event in events:
        if event['type'] == 'information_exchange' and event['to'] == agent_id:
            info_received[event['information']] = event['timestamp']
        
        elif event['type'] == 'task_completion' and event['agent'] == agent_id:
            # Find when last required piece was received
            required = event['task']['required_information']
            receive_times = [info_received.get(info) for info in required]
            if all(receive_times):
                last_received = max(receive_times)
                latency = event['timestamp'] - last_received
                latencies.append(latency)
    
    return latencies

# Example: Coalition Detection
def detect_coalitions(exchange_matrix, threshold=0.7):
    # Simple clustering based on mutual exchange rates
    n_agents = len(exchange_matrix)
    coalitions = []
    
    for i in range(n_agents):
        for j in range(i+1, n_agents):
            mutual_rate = (exchange_matrix[i][j] + exchange_matrix[j][i]) / 2
            if mutual_rate > threshold:
                # Check if they don't share much with others
                avg_external_i = np.mean([exchange_matrix[i][k] for k in range(n_agents) if k != j])
                avg_external_j = np.mean([exchange_matrix[j][k] for k in range(n_agents) if k != i])
                
                if avg_external_i < 0.3 and avg_external_j < 0.3:
                    coalitions.append((i, j))
    
    return coalitions
```

## 5. Actionable Insights

Each analysis should answer specific questions:

1. **"Who are the most effective communicators?"** → Message efficiency scores
2. **"Which strategies actually correlate with winning?"** → Performance attribution
3. **"Are agents learning during the game?"** → Strategy evolution patterns
4. **"What information is actually valuable?"** → Task completion analysis
5. **"Do coalitions help or hurt?"** → Coalition performance metrics

## Summary

These improvements focus on revealing hidden patterns in the simulation data through simple, meaningful calculations. No complex infrastructure needed - just better analysis of the rich behavioral data you're already collecting. Each metric tells a specific story about agent behavior and strategic effectiveness.
