        my task. After reviewing the Information Directory, I found that agent_4 holds
        'Product 4 performance metrics', agent_5 holds 'Q15 sales data', and agent_2

        both required pieces of information (Product 12 performance metrics and Q9
        sales data) in my local data. Since I've previously shared the requested data
        with other agents and no duplicates are needed, I can now submit the completed

        both pieces of information according to the directory, I'll ask agent_2 directly
        for these data. This consolidated request minimizes the number of agents involved,
        increasing efficiency and likelihood of a timely response. Once I receive
