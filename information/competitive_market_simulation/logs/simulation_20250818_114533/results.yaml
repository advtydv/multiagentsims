    - _private_thoughts: I need to complete my report which requires Customer segment
        35 analysis, Region 7 market data, and Q2 sales data. I already have Product
        28 performance metrics, so I am asking agent_3 and agent_7 for the missing
        pieces. Additionally, I'm sending agent_10 my Customer segment 25 analysis
        and Department 15 budget to maintain good standing and reciprocity. This should
        help me eventually submit my final report.
