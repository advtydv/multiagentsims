        analysis is a bit lower at 66, and the Product 4 performance metrics are lower

        already contain these pieces with specified quality ratings. I also have the

        Agent_2 was originally contacted for the Department 12 budget and they also

        data, which is rated at a quality of 76, is reliable for our forecast analysis,
