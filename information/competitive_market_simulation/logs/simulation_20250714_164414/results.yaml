      private_thoughts: I am repeatedly requesting Q3 sales data and Product 17 performance
        metrics from all agents who have them because these are required for my forecast
        task. Agents 1 and 3 have not responded despite multiple requests, so I am
        making a final push to get their cooperation. Agent 5 also has Q3 sales data
        but hasn't responded yet, so I follow up with them too. Agent 2 has been unresponsive
        on Product 17 performance metrics, but I keep requesting since they also hold
        it. I avoid sending information to others now, focusing on acquiring missing
        data. If no response next round, I may broadcast. My goal is to gather all

        I am also fulfilling agent_4's repeated urgent requests for Q3 sales data
        and Product 17 performance metrics, which I have, to maintain good relations
        and avoid blocking their tasks. Once I receive Region 8 market data, I can

        to try to get the data before the final rounds. I will not request from other

        may need to broadcast in the final rounds or find alternative strategies.

        have stopped requesting Q3 sales data and Product 17 performance metrics from
