        and Product 4 performance metrics according to the directory. This is essential

        reciprocation. I also send Q12 sales data to agent_5 to help them with their

      private_thoughts: I still lack three required pieces (Region 11 market data,

        I previously requested these from agent_1, but haven't received a response
        yet. To mitigate delays, I'm also reaching out to agent_4 who, according to

        received them yet, so a timely reminder should help. Without these, I cannot
        submit my completed task, and my strategy in future rounds is to ensure quick

        both pieces, I requested them from agent_5. Additionally, agent_2 recently
        requested Region 11 market data, Department 18 budget, and Q16 sales data,
        all of which I have, so I shared those with agent_2 to maintain good relations

        in my current information. Agent_1 has been asked multiple times, but I want
        to diversify the request by also contacting agent_2 who has the required data
